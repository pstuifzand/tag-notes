Notetaking with tags
====================

This program creates a HTML files from a notes file with a tag.

tags.pl          generates the HTML file
tag_watcher.pl   watches the notes file and calls tags.pl when the file changes


USAGE

$ perl tag_watcher.pl


DESCRIPTION

The notes.html file will be generated each time when the notes.txt file
changes. This file uses jQuery to show and hide certain notes based on the
tags. If the notes.html doesn't seem to work, then download the jquery file
from:

    http://jqueryjs.googlecode.com/files/jquery-1.3.2.min.js

Put in the same directory as the notes.html file.
